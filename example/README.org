* `active-openid` example

This example shows how to use the `active-openid` library to secure a web
application.

This example uses Keycloak as its identity provider, we have provided a Docker
composition that runs Keycloak and sets it up with our example realm and client.

Then you can run the example.

** Run Keycloak

#+begin_src shell
docker-compose up
#+end_src

You can connect to the Keycloak admin console at http://localhost:8080 and login
with the default admin user ~admin~ with default password ~admin~.

TODO: We did not yet manage to import users, so you have to create users for
testing the login yourself via Keycloak's admin console.

** Run the example application

#+begin_src shell
./run-example.sh
#+end_src

** Use the example application

http://localhost:1414

You can login with the example user ~user~ with password ~user~.
