This library provides utilities to interact with a [[active.clojure.config/Configurationli][Keycloak]]-hosted
[[https://openid.net/][OpenID]] identity provider via [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]].

* Description
  =active-keycloak= will try to discover Openid-endpoints at
  configured Keycloak Openid-instances.  Multiple identity providers
  can be configured.
* Installation
  Include the following in your project's =deps.edn= file (or =leiningen=, =boot=, ... equivalent):

  #+begin_src clojure
    {:deps {...
	    de.active-group/active-keycloak {:git/tag "v0.1.0" :git/sha "<sha256>"}
	    ...}}
  #+end_src
* Configuration
** ... via =active.clojure.config=
   =active-keycloak= provides a configuration section for projects
   using =active.clojure.config= from [[https://github.com/active-group/active-clojure#configuration][=active-clojure=]].  Below is the
   configuration schema.

   A sequence schema is provided and expected to be under the
   =keycloak= key.  [[./example/etc/config.edn][An example configuration file can be found here]].

   #+begin_src clojure
   #+end_src
   Include this configuration as a =section= in you code like this

   #+begin_src clojure
     (ns your.ns
       (:require [active.clojure.config :as active-config]
		 [active.clojure.keycloak.config :as keycloak-config]))

     (def schema
       (active-config/schema "Configuration schema for my.ns"
			     ...  ; the rest of your config
			     keycloak-config/section))
   #+end_src

   A =schema= is also provided in =active.clojure.keycloak.config/keyclaok-sequence-schema=.
* Usage
  See [[./example]].
* TODO [1/3]
  Some of the todos for this project.
  - [X] Browser based authentication
  - [ ] [[https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html][Backchannel logout]]
  - [ ] =check_session_iframe=.  Included in in discovered endpoints
    and therefore usable.  In the future, some direct support (maybe a
    [[https://github.com/active-group/reacl-c][reacl-c]]-item would be nice?).
